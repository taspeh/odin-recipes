    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
            Season with black pepper and cayenne.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. 
            Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. 
            Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. 
            Uncover and stir thoroughly. 
            Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. 
            Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
